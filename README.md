# Whatsapp Analyzer
This is a simple Android app which takes a exported file from WhatsApp and makes a simple analysisof the conversation. It supports group chats and currently it only supports the format that Whatsapp exports in Android with spanish language, but can be modified to support more formats.

It's currently been converted from Java to Kotlin and as it was created 3 years ago, it may have old Android practices which need to be replaced.
